# Blockbook Mainnet Docker

This guide will help you build and run the Docker image for Blockbook (Mainnet), which is based on Ubuntu 22.04 and includes both backend and frontend components.

## Prerequisites

-   [Docker installed on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
-   Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

## Building the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned or downloaded:

```sh
cd <path/to/cloned/repository>
```

Build the Docker image using the following command:

```sh
docker build -t <imagename> .
```

## Running the Docker Container

Create a named volume for Persistent storage using:

```sh
docker volume create <volume_name>
```

Run the Docker container in detached mode and map port `9166` on your host to port `9166` on the container:

```sh
docker run -d -p 9166:9166 --mount source=<volume_name>,target=/opt/coins <imagename>
```

## Accessing the Frontend

Once the Docker container is running, you can access the frontend of the application by navigating to:

```sh
https://localhost:9166
```

in your web browser.

## Accessing Logs

To check the logs, you can access the container shell and use the `tail` command.

First, get the container's name or ID:

```sh
docker ps -a
```

Then, access the container shell:

```sh
docker exec -it <containername> bash
```

### Checking Backend Logs

To view the backend logs, run:

```sh
tail -f /opt/coins/data/flo/backend/debug.log
```

### Checking Frontend Logs

To view the frontend logs, run:

```sh
tail -f /opt/coins/blockbook/flo/logs/blockbook.INFO
```

## Additional Commands

-   **Stopping the Docker Container:**

    To stop the container, use:

    ```sh
    docker stop <containername>
    ```

-   **Removing the Docker Container:**

    To remove the container, use:

    ```sh
    docker rm <containername>
    ```

-   **Removing the Docker Image:**

    To remove the image, use:

    ```sh
    docker rmi <imagename>
    ```

Replace `<path/to/cloned/repository>`, `<imagename>`, and `<containername>` with the actual path, image name, and container name or ID, respectively.

## Troubleshooting

-   Ensure that no other application is using port `9166` on your host machine.
-   If you encounter issues, check the Docker container logs:

    ```sh
    docker logs <containername>
    ```
